# Build and run
* I'm using yarn so the code snippets will be using yarn

## let's start with build
* First things first, Clone the repository using `git clone`

* `cd dimitri-marco` 

hint: just type `dimi` and press tab it'll fill it

* `yarn install`

This is going to install all needed dependencies

* `yarn run build`

Yes you guessed it, This command going to build the project.

## Let's run dat bi*ch

* `yarn run dev`

This command going to run the project on the port 6969( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

* You can change it from package.json just remove `--port` option from `dev` under `scripts` the default port is 1234(I'm not the one who made it, Send your issues to parcel guys)

Made with ❤️ in Egypt.
